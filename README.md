The main difference is that x86 is a 32-bit architecture, while x64 is the 64-bit extension of x86. This means x86-64 can handle more memory and process data more efficiently, allowing it to access over 4GB of RAM, unlike the 4GB limit of x86. x86-64 is also known as x64 and is fully backward compatible with 32-bit x86 software. 

x64 is faster then than x86 because 64-bit can use more RAM, and includes enhanced security.features. x64 is faster due to a larger data bus and more registers. x86 is a slower 32-bit with a 4GB RAM limitation. 64-bit is the standard and recommended choice for operating systems and applications. x86 (32-bit) uses a 32-bit bus and fewer registers, while x64 (64-bit) uses a 64- bit bus and more registers. x86 (32-bit) is limited to 4GB of addressable space, while 64=bit Can access more than 4GB of RAM and is fully backward compatible with 32-bit x86 software. x64 has more secure security features as well. In all x64 is the best  for all modern computers. It is necessary if you have more than 4GB of RAM and is essential for running demanding applications like modern games, video editing software, and large databases.
